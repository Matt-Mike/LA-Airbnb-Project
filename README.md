# LA-Airbnb-Project

## Project Summary<br/>
Dashboard analyzing the Airbnb property market in Los Angeles.<br/>

I've always had an interest in renting out an Airbnb. Being from Los Angeles, I was curious as to how the Airbnb market is performing there.<br/>
<br/>

**Skills Used:**<br/>
- **SQL** to analyze and format table data
- **Power BI** for visualization
<br/>

**Desired Insights:**<br/>
- How has the market been trending yearly?
- What are the most popular months?
- What is the average price per night?
- How many listings are there in LA?
- Where are the most popular listings located?
- What is the most popular listing type?
<br/>

## Preparing the Project Data<br/>

<br/>

**Importing the Dataset to PostgrSQL:**<br/>

First I created the following tables:<br/>

<br/>

**I then imported the files and queried the following table:**<br/>
